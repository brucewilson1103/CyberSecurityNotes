        <p>From Comptia.org:</p>
        <p>
            CompTIA Security+ is the first security certification a candidate should earn.
            It establishes the core knowledge required of any cybersecurity role and provides a springboard to intermediate-level
            cybersecurity jobs. Security+ incorporates best practices in hands-on troubleshooting, ensuring candidates have practical
            security problem-solving skills required to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Assess the security posture of an enterprise environment and recommend and implement appropriate security solutions</li>
            <li>Monitor and secure hybrid environments, including cloud, mobile, and IoT</li>
            <li> Operate with an awareness of applicable laws and policies, including principles of governance, risk, and compliance</li>
            <li>Identify, analyze, and respond to security events and incidents</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Security+ is compliant with ISO 17024 standards and approved by the US DoD to meet directive 8140/8570.01-M requirements.
            Regulators and government rely on ANSI accreditation, because it provides confidence and trust in the outputs of an
            accredited program. Over 2.3 million CompTIA ISO/ANSI-accredited exams have been delivered since January 1, 2011.
